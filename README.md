**Project 1 - Treehouse Front End Web Deveopment Techdegree**
***Profile***

In this project, I was given starter files that included an index.html, styles.css, and some images.  The index.html file contained a profile for Jane from Portland.  The instructions for the project included changing out all of Jane's info and replacing it with my own, as well as changing out the profile and background pictures.  Also, the instructions included creating a new "Experience" page and make sure all links were working. All files were checked against html and css validators for errors.  

***Exceeds Expectations***
* Added additional page - Projects
* Updated profile picture border-radius, and border color and width
* Added additional text section which included additional image
* Updated div elements to _nav_ and _section_ be more semantic

Also created additional custom.css file, which includes additional styling used on the Experience and Project pages.
